# Wi-Fi-network-optimization

# Graduate Project:

Wireless LAN is an important part in the whole network these days be because it provides mobility plus large data rates. Due to many parameters in physical and MAC layer we have to select the best parameters to obtain the maximum performance in different traffic conditions. In this project we used OPNET as a simulation tools to get the best MAC layer and physical layer parameters which provide the maximum performance in terms of capacity, throughput, and latency.
